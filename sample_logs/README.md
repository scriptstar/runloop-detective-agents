# Sample Log Files for Testing

This directory contains synthetic log files designed to demonstrate the Log Detective Agent's capabilities. Each file contains realistic but fabricated data with intentional issues for analysis practice.

## Files Overview

### üåê `webapp_access.log` (Web Server Logs)
**Size**: ~500KB | **Complexity**: Medium | **Focus**: Performance Issues

**What's Inside:**
- 24-hour period of web server access logs
- Normal traffic patterns with performance degradation
- HTTP 404 errors and slow response times
- Peak traffic causing bottlenecks

**Expected Findings:**
- Response time increases during peak hours (14:30-15:00)
- 404 errors from broken links to `/api/old-endpoint`
- Database connection timeouts during high load
- Memory usage spike patterns

---

### üêõ `application_debug.log` (Application Error Logs)  
**Size**: ~2MB | **Complexity**: High | **Focus**: Error Patterns & Debugging

**What's Inside:**
- Application startup and runtime logs
- Stack traces from various exceptions
- Memory leak indicators over time
- Database connection issues

**Expected Findings:**
- Memory usage growing consistently (potential leak)
- Recurring `NullPointerException` in UserService
- Database connection pool exhaustion
- Performance degradation over 6-hour period

---

### üîÑ `microservice_errors.log` (Multi-Service Logs)
**Size**: ~1MB | **Complexity**: High | **Focus**: Service Correlation

**What's Inside:**
- Logs from multiple microservices in one file
- Service discovery failures
- Cascade failure patterns
- Authentication/authorization issues

**Expected Findings:**
- Auth service outage causing downstream failures
- Service discovery timeouts in user-service
- Circuit breaker activation patterns
- Cross-service correlation of errors

---

### üóÑÔ∏è `database_performance.log` (Database Query Logs)
**Size**: ~800KB | **Complexity**: Medium | **Focus**: Performance Analysis

**What's Inside:**
- Database query execution logs with timing
- Slow query detection scenarios  
- Lock contention and deadlock situations
- Connection pool monitoring

**Expected Findings:**
- Queries on `users` table taking >5 seconds
- Deadlock patterns during peak usage
- Connection pool reaching maximum capacity
- Missing index causing table scans

## How to Use

### Quick Test (Small File)
```bash
poetry run python log_detective_agent.py sample_logs/webapp_access.log
```

### Large File Test (Chunking Demo)
```bash
poetry run python log_detective_agent.py sample_logs/application_debug.log
```

### Performance Analysis
```bash
poetry run python log_detective_agent.py sample_logs/database_performance.log
```

### Multi-Service Correlation
```bash
poetry run python log_detective_agent.py sample_logs/microservice_errors.log
```

## Learning Opportunities

Each log file is designed to teach specific aspects of log analysis:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring issues and trends
- **Timeline Analysis**: Understanding when and why issues occur
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Tracing problems to their source
- **Performance Insights**: Spotting bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Correlation Analysis**: Connecting related events across services

## Privacy & Security

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: These are completely synthetic log files created for demonstration purposes. They contain no real user data, system information, or sensitive details. Safe for sharing and public repositories.

## Expected Analysis Quality

The Log Detective Agent should provide:
- ‚úÖ **Clear timelines** of events and issues
- ‚úÖ **Specific error patterns** with frequencies  
- ‚úÖ **Performance bottleneck identification**
- ‚úÖ **Actionable debugging recommendations**
- ‚úÖ **Root cause analysis suggestions**

Perfect for demonstrating the power of AI-assisted log analysis!
